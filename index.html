        <h2>Made by love</h2>
        <p>With us, most of the work is done by hand – from kneading the dough to shaping many of our breads and
          pastries. At the same time, we use machines where needed, to support the process without compromising
          quality. For us, craftsmanship is key, which is why we let skilled hands guide as much as possible. The
          result is bread with soul, care, and a character that only true craftsmanship can create.</p>

        <h2> The Sourdough</h2>
        <p>Sourdough is the heart of our bakery – a living culture that gives the bread its unique flavor, character,
          and natural shelf life. Through slow fermentation, both aroma and texture are developed, resulting in moist
          bread with a crisp crust. We nurture our sourdoughs every day, just as bakers have done for generations. With
          us, you’ll find bread baked with true sourdough –
          from classic loaves to innovative creations.</p>

        <h2>Sweet bread</h2>
        <p> In addition to our sourdough breads, we also bake sweet pastries – from classic cinnamon buns to other
          delightful treats. With the same care and craftsmanship as in our breads, you get a sweeter experience,
          freshly baked every day. The aroma of warm buns fills the bakery and makes it hard to resist a little real
          "Swedish fika"</p>
